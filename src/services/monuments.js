Its design seems rooted in Persia’s wooden garden pavilions such as the Chihil Sutun, and in turn, appears to have inspired the architecture of Shahjahan’s Diwan-i-Aam, or Hall of Audience.",
          "The tomb enclosure is entered through a lofty arched gateway and has a large sunken forecourt, the largest open space in the Nizamuddin Basti. The mausoleum is made entirely of marble. Each façade of the square structure has five arches inset with intricate jaalis or lattice screens, and a doorway in the central arch providing access to the tomb.",
          "The 67-ft wide hall is divided into 25 open bays. The column capitals are intricately carved with pendentives and the walls between the columns are filled with 10-ft high jaalis. In each central bay is a doorway in these screens that provides entry to the monument. The arches above the screen are open.",
          "The monument houses 10 marble graves, including eight of Mirza Koka’s family members, as well as the wives and daughters of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal. These graves are of particular beauty, especially the main cenotaph, which features delicate calligraphy and carvings, including words from the Quran.",

On the top of the cenotaph in a medallion is written, “In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful” and below that, inside the same medallion, is written, “He is Ever Living who does not die” along with fine leaf arabesques and a marker that this tomb was made for a man. The cenotaph has a box shape with an engaged stalactite frieze and projecting base plinth with an arabesque pattern.",

          "Over several years of detailed archival research, it was found that more than 80% of the stone blocks had severe cracks and past repairs had involved filling up burst portions of stone blocks with white cement – both inappropriate and inadequate, as it masked the damage but led to even greater deterioration.",
          "High-definition 3D laser scanning was used to survey the monument, followed by studies to map the profile and condition of each individual stone. Because each stone is unique in shape and size, all original stones were retained. A major point of concern was the iron dowels (pegs) that held the marble pieces together. Due to water seepage into the roof, these dowels had been corroded, causing the marble to burst in many places. These were removed and replaced with non-corrosive stainless steel dowels that matched the originals in size. To do this, each of the 25 domes had to be dismantled, their marble blocks repaired and then put back in place. This was an unprecedented conservation effort anywhere in the world.",
          "In the 1960s, a stone wall was added to the enclosure, disconnecting Chausath Khamba from its forecourt. The wall was removed and the forecourt was landscaped with Kota stone and is now a performance venue for the Qawwali musicians who live in this historic neighbourhood.",

          "The mausoleum, which was almost lost to neglect and decay, has been renewed and preserved for generations to come through a restoration project that resulted in its inclusion as part of a UNESCO World Heritage site. In the 1950s, the ownership of this complex was given to the Bharat Scouts & Guides to serve as a camping ground. This led, in 1989, to the construction of 150 structures. Enclosure walls were demolished, disfiguring the landscape and the historic character of the site.",
          "Following twelve years of effort by the ASI and the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), ownership was restored to the ASI in 2010, allowing systematic conservation and landscape restoration to be undertaken by the AKTC.",
          "The discovery of a large portion of enclosure walls, on the demolition of the 150 modern structures, allowed the Mughal-era garden layout to be restored and, in turn, ensured the integrity of a most significant 16th-century ensemble. After careful documentation of the existing remains of original incised plaster work, restoration of the decayed decorative patterns began. This included decorative lime plastering along with lime punning. The restoration of the incised plasterworks was carried out by the master-craftsmen.",
          "Façade: When restoration began, much of the western façade had  collapsed and the southern façade had been reconstructed by the ASI in 2002-4 to an inappropriate design. During conservation works the inappropriate reconstruction carried out in previous conservation attempts. This was carefully dismantled, after which the half-domed profile on each of the five bays on the southern façade and two bays of the eastern façade were rebuilt.",
          "Roof: The undulating kangura patterns on the parapet were reconstructed by replicating the existing patterns and were finished in red polychromy and turquoise tiles. Multiple layers of cement concrete were manually removed and replaced with lime concrete made of lime mortar and brick aggregate. Missing rainwater spouts had allowed rainwater to percolate into the masonry and cause deterioration of the wall plaster. Hand-chiselled sandstone spouts were fixed on each of the four façades.",
          "Interiors: The main tomb chamber is set deep within the structure, and several feet below ground level. It is surrounded by eight rooms. that are symbolic of the hasht-bihisht plan that represents the eight heavens described in the Quran. Characteristic of the highest craft traditions of the period, the interiors have elaborate geometric patterns adorning the walls and the ceiling. The floral motifs symbolize the Islamic belief that since it is impossible to capture the face of God, and therefore He is represented through natural forms. During the restoration of the patterns in the tomb, craftsmen made sure to use tools and materials that were employed by the original builders. Parts of the striking plaster ornamentation have survived on some of the internal wall surfaces, providing the evidence required to restore missing portions.",
          "Enclosed garden: The char Bagh layout provides for a lush setting to the tomb. The Mughal Garden is home to various trees that were favoured by the Mughals, such as neem and citrus. Conservation work here started after the demolition of more than 150 illegal structures in 1989, which revealed a garden enclosure wall that was also reconstructed. The entire stretch of the wall was also visible in early 20th-century photographs taken from the roof of Humayun’s Tomb. To respect the Outstanding Universal Value of the Humayun’s Tomb World Heritage site, missing portions of the enclosure wall were rebuilt. Any trees found to be standing over the wall were allowed to remain, which occurred both in the northern section and in the southeastern corner. The enclosure wall has been rebuilt in Delhi quartzite and random rubble masonry in lime mortar by master craftsmen using traditional building techniques.",
          "Over several years of detailed archival research, it was found that more than 80% of the stone blocks had severe cracks and past repairs had involved filling up burst portions of stone blocks with white cement – both inappropriate and inadequate, as it masked the damage but led to even greater deterioration.",
          "High-definition 3D laser scanning was used to survey the monument, followed by studies to map the profile and condition of each individual stone. Because each stone is unique in shape and size, all original stones were retained. A major point of concern was the iron dowels (pegs) that held the marble pieces together. Due to water seepage into the roof, these dowels had been corroded, causing the marble to burst in many places. These were removed and replaced with non-corrosive stainless steel dowels that matched the originals in size. To do this, each of the 25 domes had to be dismantled, their marble blocks repaired and then put back in place. This was an unprecedented conservation effort anywhere in the world.",
          "In the 1960s, a stone wall was added to the enclosure, disconnecting Chausath Khamba from its forecourt. The wall was removed and the forecourt was landscaped with Kota stone and is now a performance venue for the Qawwali musicians who live in this historic neighbourhood.",
